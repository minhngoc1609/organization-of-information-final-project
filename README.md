## 📌 Introduction

### 1.1. Reasons for choosing the topic
This project was developed as part of a course requirement to synthesize knowledge in data organization, database design, ontology construction, and network analysis. Instead of using hypothetical data, we focused on **Blockchain**—a rapidly evolving field. By analyzing a collection of SCI-indexed scientific articles, we aim to provide a practical perspective on collaboration structures and research trends in this emerging domain.

### 1.2. Research Questions
1. How are citation relationships formed among blockchain-related scientific publications?
2. Which articles or authors occupy central positions in the literature network?
3. Are there distinct research communities identifiable through citation and co-authorship patterns?
